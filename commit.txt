Tabulate first 25 tickets (to show all tickets)

This commit:
 - Introduces 2 new modes: MODE_PAGINATION and MODE_NO_PAGINATION
 - The mode selected depends on whether the number of tickets exceeds 25
 - Uses the tabulate library to print the first 25 tickets (out of 101 tickets)

TODO:
 - Revert mode.changeMode() when calculating number of tickets
 - Restructure displayAllTicketsInfo() to execute based on
    - number_of_tickets
    - last_ticket_shown
