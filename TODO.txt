I have the main loop working now.

Implement each of the modes now.
    Start with displaying 1 ticket
        Error check if ticket # does NOT exist

Figure out how to serve only 25 tickets
    Find how many tickets exist
    If less than 25, then just display all of them
    If more than 25, then take first 25, display, add option to next page
        If next page asked for, pick next 25 tickets (or remaining)
