I have the main loop working now.

Implement each of the modes now.
    Start with displaying 1 ticket
        Error check if ticket # does NOT exist

Figure out how to serve only 25 tickets
    [DONE] Find how many tickets exist
    Create a mode "Pagination" or not
    If less than 25, not pagination mode: then just display all of them
    If more than 25, pagination mode: then take first 25, display, add option to next page
        If next page asked for, pick next 25 tickets (or remaining)


Refactoring:
    - main.py (done)
    - modes.py (done)
    - printer.py (done)
    - retrivetickets.py
    - utils.py (done)
